#  Simon Says Game

**Simon Says** is a classic memory-based game where users must repeat an increasingly long pattern of colors. This version is built entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks or libraries!


##  How to Play

1. Click **Start** to begin.
2. Watch the pattern of colors that lights up.
3. Repeat the exact sequence by clicking the colored buttons.
4. Each level adds a new color to the pattern.
5. The game ends when you click the wrong color.

 Try to beat your highest level!
